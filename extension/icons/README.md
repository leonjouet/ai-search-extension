# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel PNG images as placeholders.

The icons should represent a fashion search or magnifying glass theme to match the extension's purpose.
